In terms of robustness, I think I have done a good job protecting the pointers throughout the code, however I would like to know better about 
the kind of data to expect during the GPRMC parsing to better protect the parsing of the packet information, should be interesting to simulate
inputs where you get scrambled data, or information loss between MCU and GPS module.
